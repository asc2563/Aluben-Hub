### about

originaly there was all of the files and Aluben services all not fully connected then <br>Aluben Hub came along the Idea of having all of them connected was very very smart so we did it.

# smart decisions

- since we want to save time we made it so if you update the javascript or css of a individual file it will update Aluben Hub by using a script or css tag like this: "<script src=URL of website/script.js>" or "link href="url of website/style.css" rel=stylesheet type="text/css">" with the other html thing(<>)
